# Electron, React, React Router, Tailwind Boilerplate

This project simply is a boilerplate with attempts to create a valid environment to build desktop applications. 

It uses the following Technologies

- React Router
- TailwindCSS

Hopefully, this repo brings an extremely barebones structure for a working boilerplate to hit the ground running nearly instantly.
